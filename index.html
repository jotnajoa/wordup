                    I said-a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie To the hip hip hop-a you don't stop the rock It to the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat <br>Now what you hear is not a test: I'm rappin' to the
                    beat And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet See, I am Wonder Mike, and I'd like to say hello To the black, to the white, the red And the brown, the purple and yellow But first I gotta bang bang the boogie
                    to the boogie Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie Let's rock, you don't stop Rock the riddle that will make your body rock Well, so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along And next on the mike is my man
                    Hank, come on Hank, sing that song <br> Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of
                    fun and I dress to a D You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the whack I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac So after school,
                    I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend But I wouldn't give a sucker or
                    a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again <br>Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (Say what?) 'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ Everybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday
                    Inn You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend <br> Uh Master Gee, my mellow? It's on you so what you gonna do? <br> Well it's on and on and on, on and on The beat don't stop until the break of dawn I said a M-A-S,
                    a T-E-R, a G with a double E I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee <br> Well, my name is known all over the world By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls I'm going down in history As the baddest
                    rapper there ever could be

                    to the boogie, the beat <br>I said I can't wait 'til the end of the week When I'm rappin' to the rhythm of a groovy beat An attempt to raise your body heat Just blow your mind so that you can't speak To do a thing but a rock and shuffle
                    your feet And let it change up to a dance called the freak And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat Rest a little while so ya don't get weak I know a man named Hank He has more rhymes than a serious bank So come on Hank, -->

                <!-- uh, sing that song To the rhythm of the boogie the bang bang the bong <br>Well, I'm imp the dimp, the ladies pimp The women fight for my delight But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs That shock the house for the young ladies And
                    when you come inside, into the front You do the freak, spank, and do the bump And when the sucker MCs try to prove a point We're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint A-from sun-to-sun and from day-to-day I sit down and write a
                    brand new rhyme Because they say that miracles never cease I've created a devastating masterpiece I'm gonna rock the mike 'til you can't resist Everybody, I say, it goes like this Well, I was comin' home late one dark afternoon A reporter
                    stopped me for a interview She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables This young reporter, I did adore So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before She said, "Damn, fly
                    guy, I'm in love with you! The Casanova legend must have been true!" I said, "By the way, baby, what's your name?" Said, "I go by the name Lois Lane And you could be my boyfriend, you surely can Just let me quit my boyfriend called
                    Superman" I said, "He's a fairy, I do suppose Flyin' through the air in pantyhose He may be very sexy or even cute But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit" <br>I said, "You need a man who's got finesse And his whole name
                    across his chest He may be able to fly all through the night But can he rock a party 'til the early light? He can't satisfy you with his little worm But I can bust you out with my super sperm!"<br> I gon' do it, I gon' do it, I gon'
                    do it, do it, do it And I'm here, and I'm there, I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere Just throw your hands up in the air And party hardy like you just don't care Let's do it, don't stop y'all A-tick a-tock, y'all, you don't stop! Go
